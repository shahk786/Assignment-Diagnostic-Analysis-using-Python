# Assignment-Diagnostic-Analysis-using-Python

I am part of a team of data analysts that was approached by the National Health services (NHS). NHS have a problem where they are incurring significant costs, when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. Penalising patients for missing appointments can affect the poorest and most vulnerable in the community. NHS wants a data driven model to understand the reasons for missed appointments, and how it can be reduced to save money, which would benefit financially and socially. 
The two main questions posed by the NHS, that I will be investigating are:
- Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
- What was the actual utilisation of resources?

Files include:

- Data files
- Jupyter notebook
- Report
- Presentation
